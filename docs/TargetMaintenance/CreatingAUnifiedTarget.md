# How to Create a Unified Target Configuration

These instructions explain how to create a Unified Target configuration for an existing Betaflight target, starting out with the latest (4.0 or newer) firmware built for this target.


## 1. Flash the firmware onto your board

(Theoretically there is no need for the board to match the firmware that is flashed in this step, but there is a chance that the board configuration is setting an input pin on the board to be an output pin, thus leading to a short and potential hardware damage.)

- the important part is that this is the firmware for the target you want to convert to a Unified Target configuration;

- make sure to enable 'Full chip erase' before flashing, or reset to default with `defaults` in CLI;

- verify that your board is properly reset to defaults: The output of a `diff hardware` in CLI should show `board_name`, `manufacturer_id`, and lines starting with a `#`.


## 2. Get a dump of your board configuration

- re-start CLI (Disconnect / Connect), then do a `dump hardware`, save the output into a file with 'Save to File'.


## 3. Add the board and manufacturer information

- edit the file from the previous step, and verify that `board_name` is set to the target name, and `manufacturer_id` is set to the manufacturer's id as listed in [this document](https://github.com/betaflight/unified-targets/tree/master/Manufacturers.md);
- if the manufacturer is not listed, open an [issue](https://github.com/betaflight/betaflight/issues) and ask for a new id to be assigned. This issue needs to contain the following: name of the company selling the board and supporting customers of it; a website URL for this company. In a future release of the Betaflight configurator, the listing for every board will include this company name, and users will be able to open the company's website from within Betaflight configurator. Allow for a day or two for the Betaflight team to respond to your issue and assign a manufacturer it;
- for boards that are homebrew and / or not planned for commercial availability, use `CUST` as the `manufacturer_id`.


## 4. Flash the Unified Target firmware

- find the correct Unified Target for your board based on the MCU type, according to the table below. If your target's MCU is not listed, please open an [issue](https://github.com/betaflight/betaflight/issues) about this to let us know there is demand. Currently, MCU types with only one or two boards using them are not released as unified targets.

|Unified Target|MCU Type|
|-|-|
|STM32F405|STM32F405|
|STM32F411|STM32F411|
|STM32F7X2|STM32F722|
|STM32F745|STM32F745|

- find and install the firmware (4.0 or newer) for the Unified Target identified above. The firmware is available from the board type drop-down in configurator. Be aware that after flashing this firmware, the LEDs on your board will not be working - this is normal.


## 5. Do the initial setup for your Unified Target configuration

- connect to your board running the Unified Target firmware, enter CLI;

- copy / paste the contents of the dump created in 2. into CLI, then enter `save`;

- when the board reboots now, the LEDs should start working again - this is a sign that the previous step was successful.


## 6. Add custom settings for your board to the Unified Target configuration

- enter the command: `feature OSD` in CLI, just before the #master section (to switch on OSD by default);

- the following steps are optional (omitting it will give users of your board a minimal but working board configuration when using a Unified Target):;

	- set all the custom settings that are specific to your board (e.g. presets for serial RX on a specific port if the board's instructions are for users to use this port for the serial RX). Changes can be done in the UI or in CLI;

	- try to only include extra settings if you are certain that most / all of your users will want them - unwanted extra changes just make it harder for your users to use your board;

- save the changes;


## 7. Create a Unified Target configuration file for your board

- re-start CLI (Disconnect / Connect), then do a `diff all bare`, save the output into a file named `<manufacturer_id>-<board_name>.config` with 'Save to File'. It is crucial that the name exactly matches the manufacturer id and board name specified in the file, or else checking of the pull request you are going to open in a subsequent step will fail;

- edit the resulting file and identify the first line in the file starting with `# Betaflight`. This line (called the banner line) should be left untouched, and it has to be the first line in the file. Whatever content is found above this line,  delete it. Likewise, there must be no extra lines after the last line starting with `set` - delete all subsequnet lines otherwise;

- open a [pull request](https://github.com/betaflight/unified-targets/pulls) to put your target configuration into `configs/default`.
